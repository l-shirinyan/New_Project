            Our firm appreciates and understands the unique challenges of service in the armed forces. The founding 
            partner or our firm, J. Dion Guest proudly served in the Gulf War as a United States Marine tanker. It is our 
            honor and privilege to represent the military community in all areas of our practice. We can provide advice 
            and assistance to veterans, service members, and dependents through all phases of the claim and appeal 
            process. Additionally, we will ensure that our clients are informed and understand all the entitlements and 
            benefits that they may be entitled to receive, some of which they may be unaware.

              The process, however, is not an easy one. The application process for Veteransâ€™ Benefits is extremely 
              complex and requires a great deal of supporting documentation in order for a claim to be successful. 
              Furthermore, many people are not aware that they may qualify for benefits under various VA programs 
              through their own service or that of a spouse.

            If you live in Kentucky and served in the military, you might be entitled to benefits including medical 
            benefits from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VA provides benefits to disabled veterans 
            whose medical conditions resulted from their military service.
